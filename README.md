###Development

It took me around 4-5 of work to get it done from stratch.

We are storing the historical data in the local storage, ideally we could be storing this data in the database since it would be more efficient. 

As future improvements we could add data segregation by time( hourly, daily, monthly)

I have used a standard vue boilerplate with vuetify as the UI library and chartjs for charting.

I have used netlify to host the application.
